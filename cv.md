### Briefly About Myself:

Briefly about myself:
Starting my career as a technical engineer for a local ISP with minimal skills, I started to get into networking. I independently studied IT directions.
My keen interest in technology began to develop as I found my direction and job, exploring directions on my own and what I liked best,  

Three years ago I became interested in retouching. I mastered different techniques,
learned how to work with a graphics tablet, became an advanced Photoshop user, and found my first job as a retoucher.

Working remotely as a retoucher gives me extra free time, which I spend studying Frontend Development.
I'm interested in web development because this profession provides endless opportunities for professional growth,
Plus there's an abundance of free, high-quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will lead me to become an experienced Frontend Developer.<br>
